# Newphython
Flash image Game

How It Works:
When a new image is shown: The previous timer (if any) is cleared, and a new timer for hiding the image after 5 seconds is started.
When the user clicks 'Yes' or 'No': The current image is hidden immediately, and a new image is flashed with a fresh 5-second timer.
After 100 images: The game ends with a "Congratulations! Test complete" message, and the buttons are disabled.
